Welcome to the Data Science Learning Notebooks repository! This repository is designed to provide aspiring data scientists with notebooks that cover various data science topics and libraries.

## Contents

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering the following topics:

1. **NumPy**: Learn how to perform numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numeric data with NumPy.
2. **Pandas**: Discover how to manipulate and analyze data with Pandas.
<!--
3. **Matplotlib**: Get started with data visualization with Matplotlib.
4. **Scikit-learn**: Dive into machine learning with Scikit-learn.
5. **TensorFlow**: Explore deep learning with TensorFlow.
5. **Pytorch**: Explore deep learning with Pytorch.
-->
... and many Library Comming soon!

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine.
### Python Installation
here’s a step-by-step guide to install Python on your machine:

1. **Check if Python is already installed**

    Python comes pre-installed on many systems. You can check if it’s installed on your machine by opening a command prompt (on Windows) or a terminal (on macOS or Linux) and typing ``` python --version```. If Python is installed, this command will display the version number. If it’s not installed, the command will not be recognized.
2. **Download Python** 

    If Python is not installed, or if you want to install a different version, you can download it from the official Python website1. Choose the version that is appropriate for your operating system.
3. **Install Python**

    On Windows: Open the downloaded file and follow the instructions in the installer. Make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” before you click "Install Now"2.
    On macOS: Open the downloaded file and drag the Python icon to your Applications folder3.
    On Linux: Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If it’s not, you can install it using your distribution’s package manager3.
4. **Verify the installation**

    After the installation is complete, open a new command prompt or terminal window and type ```python --version``` again. This time, it should display the version number of the Python you just installed.
5. **Set up your coding environment** 

    Now that Python is installed, you can set up your coding environment. This might involve installing a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE), setting up a virtual environment, and installing additional Python packages.


Once you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, you can clone this repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Geekers-team/Python-Notebooks.git
```

Then navigate to the directory and launch Jupyter notebook:

```bash
cd Python-Notebooks

jupyter notebook
```
