# Numpy Learning Notebooks

Welcome to the Numpy Learning Notebooks repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that delve into various aspects of the Numpy package. Numpy, short for ‘Numerical Python’, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

In this repository, you’ll find notebooks that cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of array creation, manipulation, and indexing, to more advanced topics like broadcasting, array shaping, and linear algebra operations. Each notebook is designed to be comprehensive and easy to follow, with detailed explanations and plenty of code examples.

Whether you’re a beginner just starting out with numerical computing, or an experienced data scientist looking to brush up on your Numpy skills, this repository is a valuable resource. We hope you find these notebooks helpful and informative as you explore the powerful capabilities of the Numpy library. Happy learning!

## Introduction to Numpy

Numpy stands for Numerical Python and is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object (ndarray) and tools for working with these arrays. Numpy is widely used in fields such as data science, machine learning, and scientific research due to its efficiency and versatility.

In these notebooks, you will explore key concepts of Numpy, such as array creation, array manipulation, universal functions, boolean logic operations, and data aggregation. By working through the examples and exercises in each chapter, you will gain a solid understanding of how to leverage Numpy for your data manipulation and analysis tasks.

## Installation

Before you start, you need to install Numpy. You can do this using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Or, if you’re using Anaconda, you can use the conda command:
```bash
conda  install numpy
```
