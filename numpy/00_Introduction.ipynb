    "This chapter, outlines techniques for effectively loading, storing, and manipulating in-memory data in Python. efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science. One of the the specialized tools that Python has for handling such numerical arrays is the NumPy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will cover NumPy in detail. NumPy (short for *Numerical Python*) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers.\n",
    "In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in ``list`` type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size.\n",
    "NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you.\n",
